# Red Wine Quality Prediction Models

This project aims to identify, build Linear and classification models to classify quality red wine samples based on their characteristics. In order to achieve this, we will use a combination of red wine domain knowledge, such as their chemical properties and taste profiles, and statistical learning techniques, namely classification algorithms (Linear, Non-Linear, Tree-Based Algorithms etc).

# Classification Methods Used
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM - Linear & Gaussian RBF kernels
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees, Random Forests

# Model Evaluation Approach
- RMSE,MSE
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
